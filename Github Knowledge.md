# Knowledge and Practices Around Git and GitHub

This document presents a summary of my knowledge of Git and GitHub, as well as the features I master, those I use less frequently, and those I have not yet explored.

---

## Git: Local Version Control

### Mastered features
- Initialize a Git repository (`git init`)
- Clone an existing repository (`git clone`)
- Add files to version control (`git add`)
- Create commits (`git commit`)
- Check repository status (`git status`)
- View differences between versions (`git diff`)
- Browse commit history (`git log`)
- Undo or restore changes (`git restore`, `git reset`, `git checkout`)

---

## Branch Management

### Known features with less confidence
- Create branches
- Switch between branches
- Merge branches (`git merge`)
- Resolve simple merge conflicts

Branch management is part of my regular workflow, but it is not the area I am most comfortable with, especially in more complex situations.

## Working with a Remote Repository (GitHub)

### Mastered features
- Add a remote repository (`git remote`)
- Push commits to a remote repository (`git push`)
- Pull changes from a remote repository (`git pull`)
- Update the local repository (`git fetch`)

---

## Collaborative Work with GitHub

### Rarely practiced features
- Create and use Pull Requests
- Participate in code reviews

### Not yet practiced features
- Fork a repository
- Contribute to an open-source project using fork + pull request

---

## Repository Organization and Documentation

### Mastered features
- Write a `README.md`
- Create Markdown files
- Use a `.gitignore` file
- Organize a project directory structure

### Not yet practiced features
- Add and manage a project license

---

## Access Management and Security (GitHub)

### Not yet practiced features
- Managing permissions
- Adding collaborators
- Using SSH keys
- Configuring authentication

---

## Advanced Git Features

### Not yet practiced features
- Stashing changes (`git stash`)
- Tagging versions (`git tag`)
- Rewriting history
- Cherry-picking commits (`git cherry-pick`)
- Using Git submodules
- Using Git hooks

## Learning Objectives

The main topics I would like to focus on are:
- Collaborative workflows (forks and pull requests)
- Improving my confidence with branch management
- Advanced Git tools
